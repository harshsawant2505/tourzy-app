# Manipal Hackathon 2024 README Template

**Team Name:** `Panch-tatv`

**Problem Statement:** `G2 - Interactive Tourism Platform
[Tourism often lacks engagement and interactive experiences, leading to missed opportunities for travelers to discover unique local attractions and fully immerse themselves in local culture. Design a sophisticated gamified tourism application that motivates users to thoroughly explore their destination by earning points through uncovering hidden attractions and completing challenges and quests such as uploading photos taken from specific angles to match reference images. The application should also feature leaderboards, rewards, and integrated social sharing capabilities.]`

## ðŸ“œ Introduction

Our project allows `Our Gamified Tourism Application is designed to revolutionize the travel experience by combining exploration, fun, and safety into one seamless platform. When users first sign up, they can select their travel preferences, such as types of places or terrains they want to explore. The app then provides personalized recommendations to enhance their journey. The core of the app's engagement lies in its gamified features, where users earn points, complete quests, and receive badges as they discover new locations or complete tasks. They can even compete with other tourists via leaderboards, making travel more interactive.

The app also offers practical features like offline maps, allowing users to navigate without an internet connection, and a robust SOS  feature that shares their live location with emergency contacts, ensuring their safety during travel. For added fun, users can participate in in-app games like Spin Wheel, Mystery Maps, and Quizzes, all of which encourage them to explore hidden gems at their destination.

Local businesses can benefit too, as they can update their listings, such as hotels or services, and receive bookings through the app. Tourist guides can register to be hired by travelers, creating a seamless connection between tourists and the local economy. 

The app also features social media integration, allowing users to share their achievements and travel experiences directly on platforms like Instagram,twitter and Facebook. Overall, this app creates a more immersive, safe, and engaging travel experience, blending entertainment with practical tools.
